###composite - this design pattern is used when we have objects which represent tree structure

for that we need two classes as Leaf and Composite which implements Component interface

leaf is an ending object of the tree.
composite is an object that has leaves.

if an operation is doing on leaf object, same operation need to be done in composite object.
